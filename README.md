## Projects

### Dynamic Response of Aerospace Structures | Politecnico di Milano
**Nov 2023 – Nov 2024**  
Contributed to experimental activities to characterize the dynamic response of aeroelastic structures under controlled loading conditions, including wind-tunnel testing supported by optical measurements. Captured bending/flapping behavior, identified resonance characteristics, and ensured synchronization between loading conditions, acquisition, and numerical predictions to improve confidence in dynamic-response interpretation.

### Digital Image Correlation in Buckling Phenomena | Politecnico di Milano 
**Aug 2023 – Nov 2024**  
Applied digital image correlation (DIC) to study buckling behavior in thin-walled structures through full-field displacement and strain measurements. Performed experimental testing on cylindrical shells and compared deformation patterns against nonlinear numerical simulations and analytical expectations, gaining hands-on experience with optical setup calibration, large image dataset processing, and instability interpretation.

### Use of Temperature for High-Speed Deformation Measurement | Politecnico di Milano 
**Oct 2022 – Dec 2023**  
Investigated fracture initiation by leveraging temperature measurements during high-speed deformation, using a drop-tower impact setup combined with high-speed infrared thermography. Focused on extracting thermal fields to distinguish elastic from plastic regimes and estimate energy dissipated through plasticity prior to fracture, linking thermal signatures to material response under dynamic loading.

### All-Electric eVTOL Air Taxi | VFS Student Design Competition
**Aug 2021 – Aug 2022**  
Developed an all-electric eVTOL air taxi concept for The Vertical Flight Society (VFS) Student Design Competition, targeting accessibility for passengers with reduced mobility (PRM). Includes aircraft sizing, control-system concept definition, aerodynamic optimization, and structural layout development, with emphasis on balancing performance, safety, and integration constraints.

### Heat Pipes for Waste Heat Recovery | Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana 
**Oct 2020 – Aug 2021**  
Conducted a CFD-focused research project analyzing heat pipes for waste heat recovery in industrial systems for Argos (cement industry, Colombia). Developed with the Energy and Thermodynamics Research Group at UPB in collaboration with Brunel University London (UK), evaluating thermal performance and flow behavior to support engineering recommendations for industrial heat recovery applications.

### Close Air Support Aircraft, Conceptual & Preliminary Design | Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana  
**Dec 2019 – Nov 2020**  
Performed the conceptual and preliminary design of a military Close Air Support aircraft (CAS), covering aerodynamic configuration and structural arrangement, and defining key system-level choices (e.g., avionics selection). Included CAD-based modeling and simulation activities (CFD and FEA) to support design decisions toward a technically justified configuration.

### In-Flight Aircraft Failure Detection | Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana
**Dec 2018 – Nov 2020**  
Designed and developed a mechanical device capable of reproducing a realistic in-flight structural failure scenario in an aeronautical structure (I-beam component), enabling studies on failure detection during flight conditions. Developed within the SMART Materials and Aerospace Structures Research Team at UPB, translating structural failure concepts into a controllable, testable physical prototype.

### GeoGebra for Calculus Learning | Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana
**Dec 2016 – Nov 2019**  
Developed a structured guide to support the teaching and learning of Calculus and Differential Equations using GeoGebra, as part of the Mathematics Research Team at Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana (UPB). Focused on clear learning sequences and practical activities to help students visualize and understand key concepts through interactive simulations, leading to a congress publication presented at Universidad Católica de Pereira [Publication](https://editorial.ucp.edu.co/omp/index.php/e-books/catalog/view/49/45/1759).
